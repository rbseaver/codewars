# Pascal Case

## Instructions
Write a method (or function, depending on the language) that converts a string to camelCase, that is, all words must have their first letter capitalized and spaces must be removed.

_Note: The expected output is pascal case, not camel case, as the exercise name suggest. To that end, I refer to it here as pascal case._


### Examples (input --> output):

```typescript
"hello case" --> "HelloCase"
"camel case word" --> "CamelCaseWord"
```

Don't forget to rate this kata! Thanks :)

(_Note: There is an undefined use case that causes a test to fail on final submission, despite the fact that pre-submission tests all pass. Without knowing the input that was being passed to the test, I was unable to write and verify a test for the use case, so I did not complete it. I've presented my solution, regardless, because I think there is still value. As one can see in the link below, there is an active discussion about this failing use case/test, and many have had difficulty._)
